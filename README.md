Arduino Pool watering system.

In this project I made pool water heating system. We have two pumps that pump water into the tank and from there back into the pool.
The system checks the temperature of the water which is heated by the solar panels which we don't control.
The system controls water inside the tank and outside the tank and keep on when the water is hot enough.

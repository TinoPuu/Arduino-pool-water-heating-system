/*
In this project I made pool water heating system. We have two pumps that pump water into the tank and from there back into the pool.
The system checks the temperature of the water which is heated by the solar panels.
The system also controls water inlet and outlet.

Attention:
If you want to use this code for something, you have to install libraries which I use in this project also.
